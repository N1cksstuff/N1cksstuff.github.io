                        <strong>General PSA:</strong> Emmers is 18; but that doesn't mean that you should sexualize her at all.
 <br>
                        <strong>-Personal Info:</strong> Do not search for/speculate about personal information about her if she had purposefully kept it private or has ignored questions about it.<br><br>
                        <strong>-Don't baby her:</strong> (telling her continuously to go to bed because she said she was tired, telling her to go eat etc...) <br><br>
                        <strong> -Swoon/admire:</strong> Emmers is fine with people simping for her, as long as they are respectful about it. She doesn’t mind followers saying that they love her if it is clearly nonromantic. <br><br>
                        <strong> ADDITIONALLY!;</strong> she doesn't like it when people choose to admire her by saying things like “I cried because I’m not as pretty as you” or “you're cute when you're mad”. Please, please never say things like this.<br><br><br>
                        <strong>-Calling her "hot": </strong>She is fine with this if it is clearly for a joke. but otherwise please refrain from calling her hot or especially “fine.”<br><br>
                        <strong> -Tagging her:</strong> She is ok with being tagged in things such as tik tok, UNLESS it is a tiktok sexualizing her (ex: “would you f*ck your first @“) like c'mon people.<br><br>
                        <strong>-Location/finding her outside: </strong> she is uncomfortable with people trying to find her. If you see her in public, Emmers is comfortable with you saying hi, as long as you are not weird about it (don’t follow her around)!<br>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>-Cosplay:</strong> Emmers says that she thinks it’s really SWAG! <br><br>
                        <strong>-Drawings/Edits/Animation:</strong> Emmers is more than okay with it and has stated she enjoys seeing people's creativity! It makes her happy! <br><br>
                        <strong>-Fan Art: </strong> She's okay with fan art as long as it's not NSFW. <br><br>
                        <strong> -Update/Fan Accounts:</strong> She is okay with these! Update accounts are fine, although she discourages role play accounts. <br><br>
                        <strong>-Profile pictures/layouts:</strong> Emmers is fine with people using her as pfps/layouts as long as they are not getting into arguments/being hateful as it would look bad on her and her community. <br><br>
                        <strong>-Drama:</strong> she does not want people to involve her in unnecessary drama. <br><br>
                        <strong>-Comparison:</strong> Please do not compare her growth to other streamers.<br><br><br>
                        <strong> People breaking boundaries: </strong> If you see someone say/do one of these things, don’t bring more attention to it. Everyone commenting and rating, or screenshotting something from another platform and posting it gives
                        it MORE attention and makes it more likely she’ll see it. She encourages people to respectfully ask someone to take it down and if they don't, just block and move on!
